poem: |-
  A house sat behind an old flint wall 
  Abandoned, haunted? If I recall,
  A perfect place for a Halloween dare.
  Knock the door then run quite fast
  back down the old worn garden path.

  Read more (below) for the rest of the story......if you dare.

* **Peeping above an old flint wall, pretending to look for a missing ball.
  A wall of glinting stones. Or were they bones?
  Broken and knobbly, of things unknown.**
* **Stepping through the wrought iron gate, roughened, with old peeling paint.
  A gate stuck wide with crumbling rust. Or was it blood? 
  Dried to a thick red crust.**
* **Gingerly, making our way up the path, pretending to look for the ball with a laugh,
  Passing overgrown beds of dead flower heads and brambles that scratched our spindly legs.**
* **Up steps to a wooden door,  ivy trailing over the porch floor.
  Above a knocker of a bear’s head. “Beware. “Knock me if you dare,”**\
  **a torn and worn bit of paper said.**
* **Of course, we dared. One bang each. Bang. Bang.
  Laughing, exhilarated we turned and ran,
  Tripped by brambles or were they bony hands?
  Grasping our feet as we ran in retreat.
  Down a path that twisted and snaked,
  Turning legs to jelly, stirring dread in our belly.
  Dead flower heads nodding., or were they skulls? 
  Jaws hung open. Whispering, wait……wait…..as we ran towards the open gate.
  Stopped, in our tracks by a thunderous groan.
  Turning, nowhere to hide, the door of the house, now open wide**
* **Silently a ball rolled down the steps,
  Is this what you came for? Come and collect.
  Of course, we didn’t. We screamed and fled.**
