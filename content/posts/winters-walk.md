poem: |-
  The darkest greys the clearest blues 
  Winter skies have many hues
  Naked trees stand tall and bold
  Watchful over winter's hold
  Many plants are now sleeping as
  the earth has slowed its breathing 
  Time to dream behind closed doors
  Watch the dog's twitching paws

  The air is cold, the sun is low
  everywhere a dusting of snow
  Time for gloves and a woolly scarf
  Hear the dog's playful bark
  excited for walks in the park.

We reconnect with our faithful friend on a winter walk. The garden in winter is quite bare, a few hellebores are flowering and some snowdrops are beginning to show their green tips through the soil, the grass is supporting an untold count of worm casts making it a muddy place to be. Time to explore our beautiful parks.
