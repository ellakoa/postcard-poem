poem: |
  Waking from a dream of fetch
  Milo gave a sleepy stretch.
  His cute black nose started twitching
  Something’s different he was thinking 
  Pressing his nose on the window pane
  Looking outside, the garden had changed
  Everything was white, which looked strange.

  Distracted by a favourite sound, 
  off to the kitchen, he excitedly bound.
  What was being chopped, chopped, chopped? 
  What was on the wooden block?
  Oh please, let it be a carrot treat, 
  one of his favourites, crunchy and sweet.

  The back door was open, the air smelt cold, 
  outside he ventured being bold.
  In the garden where he played catch,
  stood a figure with a scarf and a woolly hat.
  And what was that? A carrot nose! 
  And his favourite sticks for arms and toes!
  Milo ran in circles, he let out a bark. 
  The snowman smiled but did not remark.

  Called back inside, Milo spied carrots on a plate, 
  but it was whisked away, leaving Milo irate.
  Oh… who was getting his carrot treats?  
  All day he was puzzled until he fell asleep.

  Milo dreamt of carrots raining down 
  and reluctantly awoke to a snuffling sound. 
  Outside the window, munching carrot treats 
  were magnificent creatures with hooved feet.

  Milo was in awe of the reindeer he saw
  What a sight, on this cold chilly night. 
  The sleigh bells jingled, 
  Milo's nose tingled.
  Feeling content and at peace, 
  Milo forgot about tasty treats.

  Milo turned towards his bed 
  Where he found Santa dressed in red.
  Santa smiled and patted Milo's head, 
  and then with a wink, left in a blink.

  Puzzled, Milo searched around 
  and found placed at his feet 
  The largest, tastiest, carrot treat.
