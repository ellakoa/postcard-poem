  Happy New Year 2025.


  There are areas of the New Forest in Hampshire that are awash with elegant foxgloves in June. They stand up straight aiming for the sky, well most of them, there was this one foxglove bucking the trend, maybe it was doing a foxtrot, dancing its way in its colourful life.

  curved to find the light.
poem: |-
  Another New Year and so it starts
  Optimism and hope in your heart.

  You may dream of a path that is straight
  but often in life, the path will deviate.

  Twisting and turning along the way
  Each step claims another day.

  Aim towards the light as you go
  Take kindness in your heart to sow.

  There is no right way there is no wrong
  Dance your path and sing your song.
