title: The Sunny Dandelion
description: >
  Dandelions; have a habit of popping up uninvited, determined to stay for the
  long haul. Their happy faces open in the sun, hoping to win us over. 

  Behind where I live is a field that becomes smothered in dandelions in the spring, it is joyful. All too soon the intricate seed heads are ready to set sail. It is mesmerising to watch so many dandelion seeds take flight at once.

poem: |
  The Sunny dandelion tries so hard
  To be loved as other plants are.

  Eager to please with 
  a bright yellow mane
  They smile in the sun
  and close in the rain

  They dig their roots deep
  and spread their seeds far
  to show what a clever 
  little plant they are.

  Truth to tell, you are loved,

  You are loved by butterflies and bees
  and the child who spreads your
  delicate seeds, 
  with each tiny breath
  away they depart.
  Your dandelion clock 
  is a work of art.
