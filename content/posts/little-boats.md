poem: |
  Bag of chips and not a gull in sight
  an evening stroll to the harbour lights.
  There's a nip in the air and sudden 
  blasts of wind, we are wrapped up 
  warm against a cold that stings.

  We casually stroll the harbour arm
  taking our time, completely charmed
  and as twilight darkens into the night
  the festive lights glow bright.

  It warms our cockles but not our toes
  or the tip of a now red shiny nose.
  Hot chocolate with sprinkles before
  we make tracks, we turn and wave 
  and the little boats twinkle back.
