  Lightening glared across the skies.
  Thunder roared in querulous reply.
  Clouds caught up in the clash
  unleashed an almighty splash.
  The wind attempting to end the brawl
  unwittingly created an almighty squall.

  Eventually, the storm retreated
  Its energy quite depleted.
  What was the quarrel about?
  Who knows?
  But as the storm disappeared
  The air was left refreshingly cleared.

Summer storms are often patchy and unpredictable. 

When I should probably be seeking shelter I find I am transfixed watching the towering clouds roll across the skies. Will it or won’t it reach my position?

Most of the time, like this storm passing over Ramsgate in Kent I was far enough away in Sandwich Bay to be smugly unaffected by it. Then again there are many times I have been caught out and ended up thoroughly drenched, I mean, who carries a coat in summer?
