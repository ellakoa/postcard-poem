poem: |-
  Waking from a dream of fetch
  Milo gave a sleepy stretch.
  His cute black nose started twitching
  Something’s different he was thinking. 

  Distracted by a favourite sound
  off to the kitchen he excitedly bound.
  What was being chopped, chopped, chopped? 
  What was on the wooden block?
  Oh please let it be a carrot treat, 
  one of his favourites crunchy and sweet.

  The back door was open, the air smelt cold
  outside he rushed being bold.
  In the garden where he played catch
  stood a figure with a scarf and a woolly hat.
  And what was that? A carrot nose! 
  And his favourite sticks for arms and toes!
  Milo ran in circles, he let out a bark. 
  The snowman smiled but did not remark.

  Called inside, Milo spied carrots on a plate 
  but it was whisked away leaving Milo irate.
  Oh… who was getting his carrot treats?  
  All day he was puzzled until he fell asleep.

  Milo dreamt of carrots raining down 
  reluctantly waking to a snuffling sound. 
  Outside the window munching carrot treats 
  were magnificent creatures with big hooved feet.

  Milo was in awe of the reindeer he saw
  What a sight on this cold chilly night. 
  Their silver bells jingled
  Milo's nose tingled.
  Feeling content and at peace
  Milo forgot about tasty treats.

  Milo turned towards his bed 
  and saw a figure dressed in red.
  Santa smiled and patted Milo's head 
  then with a playful wink, 
  he was gone in a blink.

  Milo found placed at his feet 
  The largest, tastiest, carrot treat.
