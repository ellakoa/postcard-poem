title: The Most Beautiful Morning Light
description: >-
  When the spring tides are low take a walk in the bay and enjoy the most
  spectacular morning light.

  Scaffold poles and old train wheels litter the chalk beds at low tides and have become home to various sea life. I have been told they are the remnants of old sea defences.

poem: |-
  When the plug is pulled in the bay 
  and the sea appears to drain away 
  take an early morning walk across 
  the shore with the whitest chalk.

  Stroll beyond the rolling pebbles and
  the groynes that reach onto the levels.
  Skirt around the sandy pools towards
  a sea that sparkles like jewels.

  Watch seabirds stalk the shallow waters,
  Listen as waves gently ebb and falter,
  Amble back as the sun's path grows bright
  Enjoy the most beautiful morning light.
