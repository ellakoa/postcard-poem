title: Deep in the Forest
description: >-
  Wandering along the path on a sunny day in the new forest I was instilled with
  a sense of joyous well-being. The sun was warm and bright, birds and insects
  were busy around, and vegetation thrived, but only along the edges of the
  path. A step off the path and the dense canopy of the forest was excluding and
  forbidding.


  The contrast between light and dark should make your feet want to stay firmly on the path, but the mind's curiosity sometimes pulls in the wrong direction and then your feet just have to follow. Getting lost in the forest ignites the imagination.

poem: |-
  Deep in the forest where the sun doesn’t heat
  Where pine needles fall and pinprick your feet
  Where birds rarely sing and ants hardly crawl
  A darkness encircles, a silence calls.

  Stray from the path and lose your way
  Night-time soon will replace the day
  Don’t rest your head, don’t count sheep
  No sweet dreams if you drift asleep.

  Disturbing critters where you tread
  Spark the jitters, installing dread
  Hold your breath, feel the heart pound
  Mind deadly toadstools all around.

  Be careful of where you roam
  Stick to the path and find your way home.
