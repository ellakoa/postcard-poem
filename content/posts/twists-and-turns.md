poem: |-
  Another New Year and so it starts
  Optimism and hope in your heart.

  You dream of a path that's straight
  but often the path will deviate.

  Twisting and turning along the way
  Each step forward claiming another day.

  There is no right way there is no wrong
  Walk your path and sing your song.
