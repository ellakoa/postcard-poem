  We have journeyed through time you and I
  Traversing the land, the sea, the sky.

  Seeking the future through many a year
  With much laughter, and a few tears.

  Sharing, caring, we quietly matured
  Reaching for stars we have endured.

  Let's stop hurtling through time and space
  Slow our feet, calm the pace.

  As we grow old and are outrun
  Time travellers we will become.

  Sitting together with a cuppa, or wine,
  Reminiscing our treasured moments in time.

The Dover Rings. If there was ever a time portal, this must surely be what it would look like. 
We travel through life at such a pace, racing into the future, busy busy busy, and then, I’m not sure when it happens, we seem to slow and instead of hurtling forwards we start looking back.
But what if there was a time portal? Where would you go? Would you go? I think I might keep my feet firmly in this time line.
