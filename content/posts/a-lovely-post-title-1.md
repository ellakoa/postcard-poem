  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change, keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension. 

  To write about the sandbanks demanded so much more than a few lines.

Lashed with rain on our outward ride 
We arrived under thunderous skies,
Flanked by inquisitive seals 
Our first glimpse of the sandbanks chilled,
Surrounded by the unpredictable sea,
Would it swallow us up or let us be?

With trepidation we stepped ashore,
Trespasses on these famed sands
The sun appeared, a rainbow transpired
An amnesty? We hoped,
While the tide had other shores to scope.

Respectfully we trod the sands
Forever mindful of those who had
gone before and what could ensue 
If we overstayed this precious tour.

We saw no ghosts, heard no eerie sighs
No ringing of bells in the distant swell
Just beautiful sands for miles and miles
Peaceful, surreal, virgin land each tide
Were we being mesmerised?

We weren't fooled by the soulful pools
The sculptured sands, a beauty wrought 
by the restless sea, a jealous master 
who guards, then strikes 
extinguishing the lights of men
binding crew and their doomed ships
to the shifting sands, eclipsed.

We left before the sea’s interception
Bowed our heads in silent reflection
A place of tragedy of many lives lost
The Goodwin Sands are there….

and then, they are not.
