poem: |
  Bag of chips and not a gull in sight
  an evening stroll to the harbour lights
  There's a nip in the air and sudden 
  blasts of wind we are wrapped up 
  warm against a cold that stings

  We casually stroll the harbour arm
  taking our time completely charmed
  and as twilight darkens into the night
  the festive lights glow bright

  It warms our cockles but not our toes
  or the tip of a now red shiny nose
  Hot chocolate with sprinkles before
  we make tracks, we turn and wave 
  and the little boats twinkle back.
