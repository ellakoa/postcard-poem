poem: |-
  Poppies open in the morning light
  Then close again before twilight
  Fields of red, a patch, or just one
  Poppies shine with hope
  in the morning sun

  Red embers glow
  as the sun sinks low 

  Poppy petals cup their face
  Closing in a tender embrace.
  Silence falls as the evening stills
  Poppy lanterns light up the fields.

Poppies are one of a handful of flowers that close at night. This I discovered on a sunny July evening.
My husband had arrived home from work and mentioned seen a glorious field of poppies on his travels. 
How could I not visit? Camera in hand off we set. It was now late evening and we found the field to be bathed in the last of the setting sun's golden rays. Most of the poppies had closed up shop for the day, it is apparently what they do and in this seemingly simple act, the field appeared to glow with little red lights. How enchanting. 
I like to think this is their act of remembrance.
