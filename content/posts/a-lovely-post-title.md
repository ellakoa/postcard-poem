poem: |-
  If I could pause and gaze
  through a window every day
  This is the window I would choose 
  with restful greens in the view.

  Echoes of the past surround
  Some things lost, others found.

  Dust and cobwebs on the ledge
  Sea lavender drying overhead
  Yellowing paint, grimy glass
  Verdigris on the brass

  I would shake my cares away
  and take a moment to pause and gaze.

Some things are better when they are old, things that were thought lost but then found come with a certain nostalgia. A visit to the Lost Gardens of Heligan is like stepping into the past. A simpler time, a harsher time, a tragic time. Rediscovered and restored with love and renewed hope.
