  Chasing the Sunset is a favourite pastime. Often, clouds arrive at the last
  minute to thwart my photographic attempts. This particular evening, as the
  grasses gently swayed in the warm breeze, the sky was streaked with colour as
  if a tub of powdered paint had been thrown across it. Glorious.
