  Lashed with rain on our outward ride we arrived under thunderous skies
  Flanked by inquisitive seals our first glimpse of the sandbanks chilled
  Surrounded by the unpredictable sea would it swallow us up or let us be?

  With trepidation we stepped ashore, trespasses on these famed sands
  The sun appeared, a rainbow transpired
  An amnesty? We hoped while the tide had other shores to scope.

The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change, keeping their secrets hidden. 
To visit is like stepping into a different dimension. To write about the sandbanks demanded so much more than a few lines. The poem is in three parts. This is part one.
