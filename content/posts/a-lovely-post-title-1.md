  The Goodwin Sands are sandbanks that shift and change, keeping their secrets
  hidden. 

  To visit is like stepping into a different dimension. 

  To write about the sandbanks demanded so much more than a few lines. 

  Transport yourself with this letter postcard.

Lashed with rain on our outward ride we arrived under thunderous skies
Flanked by inquisitive seals our first glimpse of the sandbanks chilled
Surrounded by the unpredictable sea would it swallow us up or let us be?
With trepidation we stepped ashore, trespasses on these famed sands
The sun appeared, a rainbow transpired
An amnesty? We hoped while the tide had other shores to scope.

Respectfully we trod the sands
Forever mindful of those who had
gone before and what could ensue 
If we overstayed this precious tour.

We saw no ghosts, heard no eerie sighs
No ringing of bells in the distant swell
Just beautiful sands for miles and miles
Peaceful, surreal, virgin land each tide
Were we being mesmerised?
