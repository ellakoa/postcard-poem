title: Postcard Poems

  Wandering along the path on a sunny day in the New Forest I was instilled with
  a sense of joyous well-being. The sun was warm and bright, birds and insects
  were busy around, and vegetation thrived, but only along the edges of the
  path. A step off the path and the dense canopy of the forest was excluding and
  forbidding.


  The contrast between light and dark should make your feet want to stay firmly on the path, but the mind's curiosity sometimes pulls in the wrong direction and then your feet just have to follow. Getting lost in the forest ignites the imagination.
