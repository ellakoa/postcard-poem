poem: >-
  We were baffled as to why we kept finding the empty silver wrappers of the
  chocolate treats beneath the tree, my husband was convinced I was the guilty
  culprit until one morning we discovered a partially eaten chocolate with tiny
  tiny teeth marks in a perfect circle, and I was vindicated.

  A big thank you to Nora who painted a portrait of the little mouse and allowed me to include it in the artwork for this postcard.

A little mouse snuck into a house 
to spend the cold winter days. 
When all around were fast asleep 
the bold little mouse on nimble feet
scouted for tasty crumbs to eat.

One midnight mission, there came into vision
A tree indoors! The little mouse stared in awe.
It was covered in lights and shiny things
That tree hadn’t been there before. 
Ooh! Just perfect to climb and explore.

The little mouse's nose started twitching
What was that he was sniffing?
All wrapped in silver something sweet
Could it be a chocolate treat? One lick! 
So good! Then, nibbled it up very quick.

The silver wrapper drifted down 
Settling upon the tree’s pretty gown.
The next night the little mouse did the same
and the next night 
and the next night the same again.

Soon it was noticed with a small frown
The silver wrappers littering the ground.
Who was not being very neat and who was 
eating all the chocolate treats? Was it a game? 
Each thought the other was to blame.

One night the little mouse tried to eat two,
The second one was too much to chew,
Not only the wrapper did the mouse drop 
but also the chocolate with a nibbled top.
The next day the mystery was finally solved.

There was no doubt, with such tiny teeth
A little mouse was eating the Christmas treats.
