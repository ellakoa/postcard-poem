poem: |-
  Hot summer days turn humid and heavy,
  there is a prayer for rain to clear the air.
  Fronted by warm winds, towering clouds roll in. 
  Birds fall silent. There is calm before the storm.
  The first flash in the skies, you count, anticipating. 
  The sound of thunder, escalating, rattling your bones. 
  Is there time to outrun the rain and head for home?
