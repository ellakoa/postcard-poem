poem: |
  The Sunny dandelion tries so hard
  To be loved as other plants are.

  Eager to please with a bright yellow mane
  They smile in the sun and close in the rain

  They dig their roots deep and spread their seeds far
  to show what a clever little plant they are.

  Truth be told, you are loved,

  You are loved by butterflies and bees
  and the child who spreads your delicate seeds, 
  with each tiny breath away they depart.
  Your dandelion clock is a work of art.

Dandelions; have a habit of popping up uninvited, determined to stay for the long haul. Their happy faces open in the sun, hoping to win us over. Behind where I live is a field that becomes smothered with dandelions in the spring, it is joyful. All too soon the intricate seed heads are ready to set sail. It is mesmerising to watch so many dandelion seeds take flight and dance in the wind.
