  curved to find the light.
poem: |-
  Another New Year and so it starts
  Optimism and hope in your heart.

  You dream of a path that is straight
  but often in life, it will deviate.

  Twisting and turning along the way
  Each step claims another day.

  Aim towards the light as you go
  Take kindness in your heart to sow.

  There is no right way there is no wrong
  Walk your path and sing your song.
